  /*
  * You need to implement this function!
  *
  * This is the basic description of a flood-fill algorithm: Every fill
  * algorithm requires an ordering structure, which is passed to this
  * function via its template parameter. For a breadth-first-search
  * fill, that structure is a Queue, for a depth-first-search, that
  * structure is a Stack. To begin the algorithm, you simply place the
  * given point in the ordering structure, marking it processed
  * (the way you mark it is a design decision you'll make yourself).
  * We have a choice to either change the color, if appropriate, when we
  * add the point to the OS, or when we take it off. In our test cases,
  * we have assumed that you will change the color when a point is added
  * to the structure.
  * Until the structure is empty, you do the following:
  *
  * 1.     Remove a point from the ordering structure, and then...
  *
  *        1.    add its unprocessed neighbors (up/down/left/right) whose color values are
  *              within (or equal to) tolerance distance from the seed point,
  *              to the ordering structure, and
  *              mark them as processed.
  *        2.    if it is an appropriate frame, send the current PNG to the
  *              animation (as described below).
  *
  * 2.     When implementing your breadth-first-search and
  *        depth-first-search fills, you will need to explore neighboring
  *        pixels (up/down/left/right) in some order.
  *
  *        While the order in which you examine neighbors does not matter
  *        for a proper fill, you must use the same order as we do for
  *        your animations to come out like ours! The order you should put
  *        neighboring pixels **ONTO** the queue or stack is based on the
  *        following priority condition:
  *        ** MINIMUM COLOR DISTANCE FROM THE CURRENT PIXEL **
  *        Ties are broken first by minimum y-coordinate, then by minimum x-coordinate.
  *        The HSLAPixel.dist() function will be useful, and you should
  *        take advantage of the functionality in your PriorityNeighbours class.
  * 
  *        If you process the neighbours in a different order, your fill may
  *        still work correctly, but your animations will be different
  *        from the grading scripts!
  *
  * 3.     For every k pixels filled, **starting at the kth pixel**, you
  *        must add a frame to the animation, where k = frameFreq.
  *
  *        For example, if frameFreq is 4, then after the 4th pixel has
  *        been filled you should add a frame to the animation, then again
  *        after the 8th pixel, etc.  You must only add frames for the
  *        number of pixels that have been filled, not the number that
  *        have been checked. So if frameFreq is set to 1, a pixel should
  *        be filled every frame.
  *
  * 4.     Finally, as you leave the function, send one last frame to the
  *        animation. This frame will be the final result of the fill, and
  *        it will be the one we test against.
